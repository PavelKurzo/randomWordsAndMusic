# randomWordsAndMusic
The main idea of this app is to collect random words from first API and then find music using this word's from second API.
How to use my project: you can simply download it and start in xcode using iphone 12 simulator, i was building my app on it.
Also you can fork or clone my repository. Hope it's open for it. 
When you start an application, you are going to see textfield, where you need to put a number from 5 to 20. When you decided,
which number you are goind to test, simply click the button fetch words. You will see, that data appeared in textView. That's result's 
from first API request. There are also hidden button on the screen, you will see it after fetching words. Next you can click appeared button fetch music,
to see the result of second API. The data in textView is going to disappear after you click fetch words button one more time,
in case that textField contains number.
